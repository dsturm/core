Philosophy and differences with Flarum


- Don't reinvent the wheel. Use Laravel to its full extent, GitHub's web components, etc

- Solve one problem at a time. ???

- Extendable, but with a core feature profile. Waterhole officially provides features for the 80% use case out of the box

- Progressive enhancement. A forum is a webpage, not an app

- Brand intergration - differences in the design language
